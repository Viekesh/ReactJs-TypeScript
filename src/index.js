// React Router DOM is a declarative routing library for ReactJS. It makes it easy to create single-page
// applications(SPAs) with dynamic routes and navigation.

// BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API (pushstate, replacestate, and
// popstate events) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component used to store all other
// components.

// Routes is a new component introduced in v6 of React Router. It is a wrapper for the Route component that
// allows you to group route together and provide them with common props.

// Route is a component that renders a specific component when the current URL matches its path prop.
